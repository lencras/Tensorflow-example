# Tensorflow-example
This repository contains a file that I have personally used for my University's Final Year Project.

The .ipynb file is an example of tensorflow code that relies on your own dataset for training and prediction.

New codes will be uploaded upon completion as my Final Year Project is still in progression.



Original code gotten from: https://pythonprogramming.net/

I only revised the code to my own requirements
